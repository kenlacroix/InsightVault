## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Import error: No module named 'openai'"**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"Config file not found"**

```bash
cp config.json.example config.json
# Then edit config.json with your API key
```

**"Failed to load conversations"**

- Ensure your JSON file is valid ChatGPT export format
- Try with the sample data first: `data/sample_conversations.json`

**"AI components not available"**

- Check that your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- Verify your `config.json` format matches the example
