# 🧠 InsightVault AI-Powered Personal Assistant

## Vision Statement

Transform InsightVault from a simple analytics dashboard into an intelligent personal growth companion that provides deep, contextual insights from ChatGPT conversations through natural language queries and holistic analysis.

## Core Concept
